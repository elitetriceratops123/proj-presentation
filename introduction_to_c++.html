        <h2>What is C++?</h2>
        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was created as an extension of the C programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. C++ retains the efficiency and low-level manipulation capabilities of C while also providing higher-level features for better organization and abstraction of code.</p>
        <p>It supports various paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, making it versatile for a wide range of applications.</p>

        <h2>Why Learn C++?</h2>
        <p>Learning C++ offers several advantages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> C++ allows for efficient memory usage and offers high performance, making it suitable for system software, game development, and resource-constrained environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Industry Usage:</strong> Many industries use C++ for applications like game development, operating systems, browsers, databases, and high-frequency trading systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> C++ supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, promoting code reusability and maintainability.</li>
          <li><strong>Resource Control:</strong> C++ provides direct memory manipulation and precise control over hardware, which is essential for systems programming.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="getting-started-cpp" class="mt-5">
        <h2>Getting Started with C++</h2>
        <p>To begin programming in C++, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Install a C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or Visual C++. IDEs like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion can also be helpful.</li>
          <li><strong>Learn the Basics:</strong> Start with basic syntax, data types (integers, floats, etc.), control structures (if, for, while), and functions.</li>
          <li><strong>Object-Oriented Concepts:</strong> Understand classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and other OOP principles.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Write small programs to apply what you've learned. Experiment with algorithms, data structures, and libraries.</li>
          <li><strong>Advanced Topics:</strong> Explore more advanced concepts like templates, standard library (STL), file handling, and multi-threading as you become more comfortable.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here's a simple "Hello, World!" example in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
        </code></pre>
